# DFA to C code converter
This project was performed as a part of our Winter Internship at Persistent Systems, from December 2017 to January 2018. It takes 5 tuples of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and creates a C program to validate the strings using the provided DFA logic. It makes use of GOFER- a flavour of Haskell, which uses functional programming paradigm. The .gs script can be run in gofer with the DFA input, which then creates dfa.c, the C program which has the dfa logic and can be used to validate the string using the same.
